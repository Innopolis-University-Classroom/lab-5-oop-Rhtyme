Using OOP principles, create a program that will allow a landlord to manage an apartment building with 12 units. Two broad features include reading od data and reports for finance. The program should allow the following features;

- The tenant list - list of apartment units and corresponding tenant names.
- The Rental Income Record - 12 columns, one for each month; and one row for each apartment number. Each time the landlord receives a rent payment from a tenant, a record is updated to the appropriate row and column of the Rental Income (See Table 1).
- The Expense Record records outgoing payments. It has columns for the date, the payee (the company or person to whom money is sent), and the amount being paid. In addition, there’s a column budget category to which the payment should be charged. Budget categories include Mortgages, Repairs, Utilities, Taxes, - Insurance, and so on (See Table 2).
- The Annual Summary - uses data from the Rental Income Record and the Expense Record to summarize how much money came in and how much went out during the year (See Table 3).

Use Case (See figure 1) and class diagrams (see figure 2) are included to help in developing the program.
